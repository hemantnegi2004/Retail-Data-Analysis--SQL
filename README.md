# Retail-Data-Analysis--SQL

Goal: To analyze customer transactions, product hierarchy, and store sales in order to derive actionable insights, such as sales trends, return patterns, and store performance.

Code: RETAILANALYSISCS.sql

Description:
The project involved working with a relational retail database consisting of three tables: customer details, product hierarchy, and transaction data. The transactions include product categories, sales quantities, pricing, tax, and total amounts across different store types. The workflow includes data cleaning (such as date formatting), calculating revenue, analyzing return and sales trends by product sub-category, and identifying high-performing store types.

Skills: data cleaning, SQL querying, data analysis, business insights, aggregate functions, subqueries, CTEs.

Technology: SQL Server, SSMS

Results: SQL queries were developed to clean date formats, compute revenue, identify top-selling sub-categories, analyze return percentages, and determine sales performance by store type. Key business metrics such as net sales and return rates were derived to support decision-making.
